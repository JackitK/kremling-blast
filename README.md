# Kremling Hunting Blast:
An arcade shooter with a DK 64 throwback. Shoot Kermlings to progress through levels. Based on the fan game of a similar name I made back around 2007. Avoid shooting Kongs or little monkeys. Shooting them too many times will end your game. When Kongs collect bananas you can right-click them to unleash a "Kong" power that will help you gain bonus points.

Controls: 

Left click: Shoot

Right click: Power-up a Kong (when you have bananas)

Click on Squawks in various levels for hints.
