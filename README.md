# kremling-hunting
An arcade shooter with a DK 64 throwback. Shoot Kermlings to progress through levels. Based on the fan game of a similar name I made back around 2007. Avoid shooting Kongs or little monkeys. Shooting them too many times will end your game. When Kongs collect bananas you can right-click them to unleash a "Kong" power that will help you gain bonus points.

Controls: 

Left click: Shoot

Right click: Power-up a Kong (when you have bananas)

As for the "why" behind making this... long story short. I wanted to do something for April Fools and for some reason I thought remaking my old DK fan game was the most logical direction to go in.

TBH I'm currently conflicted to fleshing this out to have all the levels from the original fan game or to go back to working on Firebrand Dash. So, I'm not going to make any promises and just work and expand on it as I feel up to it. But at least I did finish something playable in time for the holiday.
