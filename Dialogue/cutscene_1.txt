Blah! Donkey Kong! You're all washed up! ->It's been over 10 years and what do
you have to show for it?->All you've done is rehash the same adventures
and go party with that meddling plumber! ->You've even been stealing my style
for your latest go-kart run! ->Ever since those Kremlings gave up on trying
to take over the island, you've gone soft! ->I even had to come out of retirement to bail
out you and your flea-ridden friends when those 
blow-hard snow people took over our island! ->You need to revisit your roots to gain 
even an ounce of your competence back!
So, here's the deal!->I called up that King K. Rool
and dared him to take over the island.->His cronies are already here. 
So go stop them!->Take this coconut gun. 
You remember how it works? ->Just aim with the mouse and click to 
fire in spurts. Shoot enough of K. Rool's 
minions to reach the next level. ->Of course, don't shoot monkeys or your 
fellow Kongs... ->If you do that too many times,
then I'll lose all faith in you.
That's as good as a Game Over!->So? What are you waiting for? Go bonk some
Kremlings! I bet you won't even
make it past the first level!->
