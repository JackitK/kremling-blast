->[prop][play]That's it?->That was the entire game?
I could have played through all
of that during a trip to the washroom!->[prop]Come-on on Cranky! It's not like
your arcade games were THAT much longer.->Weren't you just complaining about how
there are too many big open world games and 
that people need to keep it simple?->That wasn't "simple", that was "incomplete"!->They didn't even make levels for 3 of you
Kongs in this game, let alone a final boss!->We just had a cutscene introducing Tiny Kong
and yet the campaign ended before she even
got used in a level!->[prop]Hey! Now, I'm sure the developer plans on
updating the campaign with more content in
the future.->They've just been working on all of this for
a long time, and wanted to share all the
progress that has been made so far!->That's what you think Diddy!
I know what the dealo is with these 
fan-fangled "fan games".->Whether from outside pressures, or lost of 
interest. These fan projects never get finished,
if not flat out vanish, more often than not.
->Well Cranky, fan projects like this are done
entirely for free. Fueled only by people's 
passion from the games that inspire them.->Whether this gets updated with more,
or we just get to enjoy what's already
there, I'm happy with it either way.->What did you think about all that DK?->...let's just roll the credits Diddy.->
