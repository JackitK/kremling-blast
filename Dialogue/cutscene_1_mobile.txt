Blah! Donkey Kong! You're all washed up! ->It's been over 10 years and what do
you have to show for it?->All you've done is rehash the same adventures,
party with that meddling plumber,
and make kids yearn for the mines! ->Not to mention stealing my style!
I ought to fine ya for that makeover!->What I'm getting at is that you've gone soft!
You're a babysitter for time paradoxes 
now-a-days! ->I even had to come out of retirement to bail
you out, when those blow-hard snow people 
took over!->You need to revisit your roots to gain 
even an ounce of your competence back!
So, here's the deal!->I called up that King K. Rool
and dared him to take over the island.->His cronies are already here. 
So, go stop them!->[prop]Take this coconut gun. 
You remember how it works? ->[prop]Tap these enemies on the screen
to fire in spurts and get K.Rool's minions
Tap enough to reach the next level.->[prop]Of course, don't shoot monkeys 
or your fellow Kongs... ->If you do that too many times,
then I'll lose all faith in you.
That's as good as a Game Over!->[hide_all_props]So? What are you waiting for? Go bonk some
Kremlings! I bet you won't even
make it past the first level!->
